# care_share: Care Coordination for Informal Caregivers

The following repository includes an MVP for a care coordination application based on the IONIC framework (e.g. Angular and Cordova).

The goal of the project is to allow informar caregivers to coordinate care by storing medical history, events, notes and getting analytics.

It has been interfaced to a Firebase database to make data storage easier.

It was designed without previous knowledge of the frameworks so it can definitely be redesigned.
